NSS Stands for National Service Scheme:

The National Service Scheme (NSS) is an Indian government-sponsored public service program conducted by the Department of Youth Affairs and Sports of the Government of India. Popularly known as NSS, the scheme was launched in Gandhiji's Centenary year, 1969. Aimed at developing student's personality through community service, NSS is a voluntary association of young people in Colleges,
Universities and at +2 level working for a campus-community linkage.

The project is an iOS app which was built for the purpose of simpligyinh communication between the faculty, coordinators as 
well as students, regarding various events being organised by the club.
The app is accessible by a student/faculty/coordinator.
